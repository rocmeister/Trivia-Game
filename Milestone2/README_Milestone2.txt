GAMEPLAY

About the game
Answer trivia questions about Europe or Asia and watch your score grow (hopefully)!

How to start the game
Connect to the Discovery Server.
Connect to The Silk Road Game server.
Join the game lobby.
You will be assigned to a team of 2, and a button should appear that allows you to either play the Passport to Europe map, or the All About Asia map, click that button and that should start the game for you. It is advised that you don’t play on full screen.

Game rules
Players can earn or lose the amount of points specified on the text X over each map annotation. If a player answers a trivia question correctly, he will earn X points, and if he answers incorrectly, he will lose (X - 1) points so that he is slightly more incentivised to take risk on places he isn’t very familiar with. If he closes the question window without answering, he will be penalized for 2 points. Each player starts with 0 points.
The game ends when every player has submitted their final score, or when the 5 minute timer has run out. Each team’s final score is the average of the team members’ scores and the highest scored team(s) wins!
After you submit your score, you can still continue to explore the remaining questions if any but your individual score will no longer be affected.
We want to make a solemn statement here that by playing this game you agree to strictly adhere to the Rice honor code, and any kind of unauthorized assistance are considered a violation and Dan Wallach will come at your doorstep!

Game Controls
[Top panel]
Shows a flat earth view with annotations. Upon clicking these annotations, a pop up window will appear allowing you to answer questions. You can choose to click one of the answer or close the window and take a 2 point penalty.

[Bottom panel] from left to right, top to bottom
The submit score textfield shows your current score, and the submit button can be clicked only once, so make your submission decision carefully! To the right is a timer that counts down the amount of time left.

The text area down below shows the correct answer for each question and some interesting facts about that place.

Game Strategy
Perhaps the best advice we can give is to look what country/city the annotations are located at and assess how familiar you are with it. Then, use the reward/penalty number to decide whether it is worth it to answer this question. Remember you can always choose to submit the score you have right now!

To help you gauge the risk and rewards, both set of trivias contain 10 questions distributed as: three difficulty level-1 questions, three level-2, three level-3, and one level-4 question.

And finally, don’t forget to talk to your teammate! Communication can be crucial to maximizing your team’s score.
