/**
 * IChatroom is chat rooms for both in-game teams and outside-game chat groups.
 * It is used for both inter-team and intra-team communications. 
 * It keeps track of the IMember stubs of the all the members in a chat group
 * and defines how communication with those members can occur. 
 *
 * Each instance of IChatroom needs a unique id.
 * 
 * IMember stubs are added to the chatroom via a "Join" message (a known message type). Similarly,
 * IMember stubs can leave a chatroom using a "Leave" message (another known message type). So,
 * we don't need add() or leave() methods in this interface.
